# Minecraft New Tab Background and Update Countdown

A Chrome extension that sets your New Tab page background to a Minecraft-themed photo, and includes a countdown for new Minecraft updates!

Here's an example:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slushie0/cavesandcliffscountdown/main/demo.png">

For a live demo see [this](https://slushie0.github.io/minecraft-theme-extension/newtab.html). This is exactly what your new tab page would be like. Reload it a few times to se the different images.

(And yes, I released it here on github because I'm too poor to pay to release it on the Chrome Web Store.)
